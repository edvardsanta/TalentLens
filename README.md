# Talent Lens

Talent Lens is a tool designed to analyze resumes and provide insights into the predominant nature of the candidate's skillsâ€”whether they lean towards soft skills or hard skills. 


## Transition to React

The decision to switch to React for Talent Lens was made to reassess and test some core front-end concepts. While Svelte offered an excellent experience and i appreciate its simplicity and performance benefits, React provides a robust ecosystem and a component-based architecture that is beneficial for this simple project.


## Overview

Talent Lens serves as a platform where recruiters and HR professionals can upload candidates' resumes. The application then processes these resumes to highlight key areas such as:

- **Professional Experience**: Summarizes the candidate's past roles and industries they've worked in.
- **Education**: Outlines academic qualifications and certifications.
- **Skills Assessment**: Categorizes listed skills into 'soft' and 'hard' skills.
- **Skill Profiling**: Determines if the candidate is more oriented towards soft skills or hard skills based on the analysis.

The final output presents a profile that aids decision-makers in understanding the candidate's potential and suitability for roles requiring specific skill sets.
